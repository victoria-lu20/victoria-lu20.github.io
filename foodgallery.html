        <p class = "content">
            For this website, there were many requirements that we needed to satisfy, including the following:
        </p>
        <ul class = "content">
            <li>the gallery must be designed for one specific target audience</li>
            <li>it must be aesthetically pleasing and follow visual design principles</li>
            <li>utilize HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL</li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "content">
        The gallery that I designed consists of food images and descriptions, and has a target audience of individuals who are interested in food and/or are looking for places to eat.
