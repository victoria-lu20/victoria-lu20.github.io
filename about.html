        Hi! I’m from New Jersey, and currently studying at Cornell University.  I’m majoring in Information Science (double concentrating in UX/UI Design and Data Science) and minoring in Design + Environmental Analysis. On campus, I’m a part of two different magazines, Crème de Cornell and Guac Travel Magazine, working on layout design and web development.
    </p>
    <p class = "descrip">
        I am particularly interested in the intersection of sustainability and design, and how to design both spaces and products to be more environmentally-friendly. But in my free time, I love to travel and eat!
